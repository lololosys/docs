# Export Google Docs to WordPress Yoast SEO Fields

Docswrite supports exporting your Google Docs content directly to WordPress [Yoast SEO](https://yoast.com/seo-blog/) fields, making it easy to optimize your posts for search engines right from your document.

## How Yoast SEO Integration Works

When exporting a Google Doc, Docswrite detects your Yoast SEO fields and allows you to map content from your document to those fields. This enables you to:

- Set SEO title, meta description, and focus keyword directly from your Google Doc
- Automate SEO metadata population for every post
- Eliminate manual copy-paste into Yoast SEO fields in WordPress

## Step 1: Set Up Yoast SEO on Your WordPress Site

1. Install and activate the [Yoast SEO plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/).
2. Configure your basic SEO settings in the Yoast SEO dashboard.

## Step 2: Connect Your WordPress Site to Docswrite

Follow the [WordPress integration guide](/integrations/wordpress/api) to connect your site via API or plugin.

## Step 3: Map Google Doc Content to Yoast SEO Fields

1. In the Docswrite dashboard, select your Google Doc(s) to export.
2. In the export settings, you'll see a section for **Yoast SEO** fields.
3. Docswrite will automatically fetch the available Yoast SEO fields for your post type.
4. Map each Yoast SEO field to a section or property from your Google Doc, such as:

   - **SEO Title**: Map to your document title or a custom heading.
   - **Meta Description**: Map to a summary or custom paragraph.
   - **Focus Keyword**: Map to a keyword or phrase in your doc.

## Step 4: Publish!

Click **Publish to WordPress**. Docswrite will create a new post (or update an existing one) and populate all mapped Yoast SEO fields automatically.
