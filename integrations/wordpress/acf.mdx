# Google Docs to WordPress ACF: Effortless Field Mapping

Docswrite makes it easy to export your Google Docs content directly into [Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) on your WordPress site, streamlining structured publishing and eliminating manual data entry.

## How Docswriteâ€™s ACF Integration Works

When you export a Google Doc, Docswrite automatically detects your ACF field groups and lets you map content from your document to each custom field. This allows you to:

- Populate any custom post type and ACF field (text, image, repeater, etc.)
- Automate structured content workflows
- Avoid tedious copy-paste into WordPress

Learn more about the integration on the [Docswrite ACF product page](https://docswrite.com/product/acf).

## Step 1: Prepare ACF on Your WordPress Site

1. Install and activate the [Advanced Custom Fields plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/).
2. Create your custom fields and assign them to the relevant post type(s).

## Step 2: Connect Your WordPress Site to Docswrite

Connect your site to Docswrite using the [WordPress API or plugin integration](/integrations/wordpress/api).

## Step 3: Map Google Doc Content to ACF Fields
