# Export Google Docs to WordPress Newspack Fields

Docswrite supports exporting your Google Docs content directly to WordPress [Newspack](https://newspack.blog/) fields, making it easy to publish and optimize your articles for digital newsrooms right from your document.

## How Newspack Integration Works

When exporting a Google Doc, Docswrite detects your Newspack fields and allows you to map content from your document to those fields. This enables you to:

- Set headline, excerpt, and byline directly from your Google Doc
- Populate Newspack-specific fields such as "Article Subtitle" or "Featured Image"
- Automate structured content population for every post
- Eliminate manual copy-paste into Newspack fields in WordPress

## Step 1: Set Up Newspack on Your WordPress Site

1. Install and activate the [Newspack plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/newspack-plugin/).
2. Configure your newsroom and article settings in the Newspack dashboard.

## Step 2: Connect Your WordPress Site to Docswrite

Follow the [WordPress integration guide](/integrations/wordpress/api) to connect your site via API or plugin.

## Step 3: Map Google Doc Content to Newspack Fields

1. In the Docswrite dashboard, select your Google Doc(s) to export.
2. In the export settings, you'll see a section for **Newspack** fields.
3. Docswrite will automatically fetch the available Newspack fields for your post type.
4. Map each Newspack field to a section or property from your Google Doc, such as:

   - **Headline**: Map to your document title or a custom heading.
   - **Excerpt**: Map to a summary or custom paragraph.
   - **Byline**: Map to an author field or text in your doc.
   - **Article Subtitle**: Map to a subheading or custom field.
   - **Featured Image**: Map to an image in your doc.

Click **Publish to WordPress**. Docswrite will create a new post (or update an existing one) and populate all mapped Newspack fields automatically.
