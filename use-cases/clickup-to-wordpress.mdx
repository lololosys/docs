## Step 2: Make Your Google Doc Publicly Accessible

Before Docswrite can access your Google Doc, you need to ensure the document is publicly viewable. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Open your Google Doc.**
2. Click on **_File_ â†’ _Share_ â†’ _Share with others_**.

3. In the sharing settings, set the document so that **"Anyone with the link can view"**.

   > ðŸ’¡ _If your document isnâ€™t public, Docswrite wonâ€™t be able to fetch its content!_

4. Copy the shareable link and save it for the next step to put it in your ClickUp taskâ€™s custom field.

## Step 3: Set Up Your ClickUp Workspace

1. **Create a ClickUp Space or List:** Organize your content workflow in ClickUp.
2. **Add Tasks:** Create a task for each piece of content you plan to publish. Include details like the title, tags, or categories.
3. **Add Custom Fields:**
   - **Google Docs Link:** Add a custom field named "Google Docs"â€”this is where youâ€™ll paste the public link to your Google Doc.
   - **Content Editor:** Add a custom field named "Content Editor" and set its value to either `gutenberg_editor` or `classic_editor` depending on your preferred WordPress editor.
   - **Author:** Add a custom field named "Author" with your author name.
   - If there are any other custom fields that you wish to control, just specify them in the custom fields.
