### How to Use the Template

1. **Copy the template**: Make a copy of our template Google Doc to your own Google Drive
2. **Customize the fields**: Replace the example values with your actual content
3. **Add your content**: Write your main content below the table
4. **Publish**: Use Docswrite to export directly to WordPress

The template ensures that all your WordPress metadata, SEO settings, and custom fields are properly configured before publishing, saving you time and ensuring consistency across your content.
