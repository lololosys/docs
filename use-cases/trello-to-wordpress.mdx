## Step 2: Make Your Google Doc Publicly Accessible

Before Docswrite can access your Google Doc, you need to ensure the document is publicly viewable. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Open your Google Doc.**
2. Click on **_File_ â†’ _Share_ â†’ _Share with others_**.

3. In the sharing settings, set the document so that **"Anyone with the link can view"**.

   > ðŸ’¡ _If your document isnâ€™t public, Docswrite wonâ€™t be able to fetch its content!_

4. Copy the shareable link and save it for the next step to put it in your Trello cardâ€™s custom field.
