## Step 2: Make Your Notion Page Publicly Accessible

Before Docswrite can access your Notion page, you need to ensure the page is shared correctly. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Open your Notion page.**
2. Click on **Share** in the top right corner.
3. Toggle on **Share to web** so that **"Anyone with the link can view"**.

   > ðŸ’¡ _If your Notion page isnâ€™t shared to the web, Docswrite wonâ€™t be able to fetch its content!_

4. Copy the shareable link and save it for the next step to put it in your Notion database property.

## Step 3: Set Up Your Notion Database

1. **Create a Notion Database:** Organize your content workflow in Notion.
2. **Add Pages:** Create a page for each piece of content you plan to publish. Include details like the title, tags, or categories.
3. **Add Properties:**
   - **Notion Page Link:** Add a property named "Notion Link"â€”this is where youâ€™ll paste the public link to your Notion page.
   - **Content Editor:** Add a property named "Content Editor" and set its value to either `gutenberg_editor` or `classic_editor` depending on your preferred WordPress editor.
   - **Author:** Add a property named "Author" with your author name.
   - If there are any other custom properties that you wish to control, just specify them in the database.
