# Programmatic SEO (PSEO) with Docswrite

Programmatic SEO (PSEO) allows you to generate and publish thousands of SEO-optimized pages at scale, targeting long-tail keywords and increasing your website's organic reach. With Docswrite, you can automate the creation and publishing of these pages directly from Google Docs to your CMS, such as WordPress.

## What is Programmatic SEO?

Programmatic SEO is the process of using automation to create large numbers of unique, high-quality pages that target specific keyword variations or data-driven topics. This approach is ideal for:

- Location-based landing pages (e.g., "Best dentists in [City]")
- Product or service variations
- Data-driven content (e.g., statistics, directories, templates)
- Comparison pages

## How Docswrite Enables Programmatic SEO

Docswrite streamlines the PSEO workflow by letting you:

- **Create content templates in Google Docs** with placeholders for dynamic data (e.g., {{city}}, {{service}}, {{price}})
- **Upload or connect a data source** (CSV, Google Sheets, or API) containing the variables for each page
- **Automatically generate unique Google Docs** for each data row, replacing placeholders with actual values
- **Bulk export and publish** all generated docs to your CMS (WordPress, Contentful, etc.) with proper formatting, images, and SEO metadata

## Step-by-Step: Launching a Programmatic SEO Campaign

### 1. Prepare Your Content Template

1. In Google Docs, write a template for your page. Use curly braces for variables, e.g.:

   ```
   # Best {{service}} in {{city}}

   Looking for the best {{service}} in {{city}}? Our team offers top-rated {{service}} at affordable prices.
   ```

2. Save your template in your Google Drive.

### 2. Prepare Your Data Source

- Create a CSV or Google Sheet with columns matching your placeholders (e.g., `city`, `service`, `price`).
- Each row represents a unique page.

### 3. Connect Docswrite

1. Go to the [Docswrite Dashboard](https://docswrite.com/dashboard).
2. Click **Connect Site** and select your CMS (e.g., WordPress).
3. Link your Google Account and authorize Docswrite to access your Google Docs.

### 4. Generate Pages Programmatically

1. In Docswrite, select your content template.
2. Upload your CSV/Sheet or connect your data source.
3. Docswrite will generate a unique Google Doc for each row, replacing placeholders with your data.

### 5. Bulk Export and Publish

1. Select all generated Google Docs.
2. Click **Export** and choose your connected CMS.
3. Configure export options (post type, categories, tags, SEO fields).
4. Click **Publish** to send all pages live.

Docswrite will automatically convert each Google Doc into a published page, preserving formatting, images, and metadata.
