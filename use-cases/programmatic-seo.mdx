# Programmatic SEO (PSEO) with Docswrite

Programmatic SEO (PSEO) allows you to generate and publish thousands of SEO-optimized pages at scale, targeting long-tail keywords and increasing your website's organic reach. With Docswrite, you can automate the creation and publishing of these pages directly from Google Docs to your CMS, such as WordPress.

## What is Programmatic SEO?

Programmatic SEO is the process of using automation to create large numbers of unique, high-quality pages that target specific keyword variations or data-driven topics. This approach is ideal for:

- Location-based landing pages (e.g., "Best dentists in [City]")
- Product or service variations
- Data-driven content (e.g., statistics, directories, templates)
- Comparison pages

## How Docswrite Enables Programmatic SEO

Docswrite streamlines the PSEO workflow by letting you:

- **Create content templates in Google Docs** - create content in Google Docs with curly barces to create a templated content
- **Select your Google Sheet** - containing the variables for each page
- **Automatically generate unique Google Docs** for each data row, replacing placeholders with actual values
- **Bulk export and publish** all generated docs to your CMS (WordPress, Contentful, etc.) with proper formatting, images, and SEO metadata

## Step-by-Step: Launching a Programmatic SEO Campaign
