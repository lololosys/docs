## Connect Your WordPress Site

Connecting your WordPress site to Docswrite is simple and takes just a few steps. This guide works for both WordPress.com and self-hosted WordPress sites.

## Connection Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy your WordPress Site URL">
    First, copy your WordPress site URL. You can find it in your WordPress Dashboard → Settings → General → Site Address (URL).

    Make sure to copy the **Site Address (URL)**, not the WordPress Address.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Click on Connect WordPress Site">
    In your Docswrite dashboard, click on the "Connect WordPress Site" button. This will open a connection modal.

    - Upload images to your media library
    - Access categories and tags
    - Set post metadata and SEO settings

  </Step>
</Steps>

## WordPress.com vs Self-Hosted

### WordPress.com Sites

For WordPress.com hosted sites, the connection process is straightforward - just follow the steps above and you're ready to go!

### Self-Hosted WordPress Sites

For self-hosted WordPress sites, you may need to:

1. **Enable Application Passwords** (WordPress 5.6+)
2. **Install our WordPress Plugin** for enhanced features
3. **Check Permissions** to ensure your user can publish posts

### Troubleshooting Self-Hosted Sites

If you're having trouble connecting your self-hosted WordPress site:

**Check WordPress Version**

- Ensure you're running WordPress 5.6 or higher
- Application passwords are required for authentication

**Enable Application Passwords**

```php
// Add to your wp-config.php if needed
define('WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE', 'production');
```

**Plugin Installation**
Consider installing our [WordPress Plugin](/essentials/wordpress-plugin) for:

- Better compatibility
- Enhanced SEO features
- Improved error handling

## Connection Requirements

Your WordPress site must have:

- ✅ WordPress 5.6 or higher
- ✅ REST API enabled (default)
- ✅ User with publishing permissions
- ✅ HTTPS enabled (recommended)

## Security & Permissions

Docswrite uses secure OAuth 2.0 authentication and only requests the minimum permissions needed:

- **Posts**: Create, edit, and publish posts/pages
- **Media**: Upload and manage images
- **Categories/Tags**: Create and assign categories and tags
- **Users**: Access author information

You can revoke access at any time from your WordPress admin panel.

## After Connection

Once connected, you can:

- ✅ Publish Google Docs directly to WordPress
- ✅ Schedule posts for future publication
- ✅ Set categories, tags, and SEO metadata
- ✅ Upload and optimize images automatically
- ✅ Use all Docswrite features and integrations

## Multiple WordPress Sites

You can connect multiple WordPress sites to the same Docswrite account:

1. Complete the connection process for each site
2. Select the target site when publishing
3. Use different parameters for different sites
4. Set up separate Zapier workflows if needed
